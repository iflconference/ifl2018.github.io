  <h2 id="th-symposium-on-implementation-and-application-of-functional-languages">30th Symposium on Implementation and Application of Functional Languages </h2>
  <p>University of Massachusetts Lowell, MA, USA</p>
<!--  <p>In cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN</p> -->
  <p>Wednesday September 5th - Friday September 7, 2018</p>
  <p>http://2018.iflconference.org/</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
  <p>The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively engaged
in the implementation and application of functional and function-based
programming languages. IFL 2018 will be a venue for researchers to present and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results
related to the implementation and application of functional languages and
function-based programming.</p>

  <h2 id="peer-review">Topics of interest</h2>
  <p>Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:
	 <ul> 
<li> language concepts
<li> type systems, type checking, type inferencing
<li> compilation techniques
<li> staged compilation
<li> run-time function specialization
<li> run-time code generation
<li> partial evaluation
<li> (abstract) interpretation
<li> metaprogramming
<li> generic programming
<li> automatic program generation
<li> array processing
<li> concurrent/parallel programming
<li> concurrent/parallel program execution
<li> embedded systems
<li> web applications
<li> (embedded) domain specific languages
<li> security
<li> novel memory management techniques
<li> run-time profiling performance measurements
<li> debugging and tracing
<li> virtual/abstract machine architectures
<li> validation, verification of functional programs
<li> tools and programming techniques
<li> (industrial) applications
	 </ul> 
  </p>
	  
	  
  <h2 id="submission-details">Submissions and peer-review</h2>

<p>
	IFL 2018 solicits two kinds of submissions:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Regular papers</b> (12 pages including references)
  <li> <b>Draft papers for presentations</b> ('weak' limit between 8 and 15 pages)
</ol>
</p>

<p>
	<u>Regular papers</u> will undergo a rigorous review by the program
	committee, and will be evaluated according to their correctness,
	novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity. A set of
	regular papers will be conditionally accepted for publication. Authors
	of conditionally accepted papers will be provided with committee
	reviews along with a set of mandatory revisions. 
	Regular papers not accepted for publication may be considered as draft papers, at the
	request of the author.
</p>

<p>
	<u>Draft papers</u> will be screened to make sure that they are within the
	scope of IFL, and will be accepted for presentation or rejected
	accordingly.
</p>
</br>

<p>	
	<h5>Prior to the symposium:</h5>

		  <u>Authors of conditionally accepted papers and accepted presentations</u> will
	  submit a pre-proceedings version of their work that will appear in the draft
	  proceedings distributed at the symposium. The draft proceedings does not
	  constitute a formal publication.
  
	  We require that at least one of the authors present the work at IFL 2018. 
</p>
<p>
		<h5>After the symposium:</h5>

	  <u>Authors of conditionally accepted papers</u> will submit a revised versions of
	  their paper for the formal post-proceedings. 
	  The program committee will assess whether the mandatory revisions have been
	  adequately addressed by the authors and thereby determines the final
	  accept/reject status of the paper.
  </br>
  
  <i>Our interest is to ultimately accept all conditionally accepted papers. If you are an author of a conditionally accepted paper, please make sure that you address all the concerns of the reviewers. </i>
</p>
<p>
	  <u>Authors of accepted draft papers</u> for presentation will be given the opportunity to incorporate
	  the feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to submit a
	  revised full article for the formal post-proceedings. 
	  The program committee will evaluate these submissions according to their
	  correctness, novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity, and
	  will thereby determine whether the paper is accepted or rejected.
</p>

<br>
<p>
At no time may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other venues; submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy: <a href= "http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication</a>
</p>

  <h2 id="peter-landin-prize">Peter Landin Prize</h2>
  <p>The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the program committee based on the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.</p>
